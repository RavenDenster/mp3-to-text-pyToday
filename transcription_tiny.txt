 I've never bothered you. I've never promised to. I won't never follow you. I won't never bother you. Now I stay what I get on. I won't be no way to get on. I'm on the way from here. You won't be afraid of fear. The thaw was booting the best. And the laws, the way we're coming to this. The things I never pass last to, I'm now a foul from the ground. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! I love you, darling. You love you, darling. You love me. Someone come inside. I know a lot to hide. Let's talk about someone else. It's to me and so we can't stop. No matter how bad the world is, it's just once and love is sad. I wouldn't look away from here. You won't be afraid of fear. And the thorn knows we'll end up this. I always know to count my nails. I don't know if it's a swell, I don't know about the world. I love you, darling. You love me. I love you, darling. You love me. I love you, darling. You love me. I love you, darling. I love you, dear. I love you, darling. You love me, darling. You love me, darling. You love your rights, you love your rights. I love you, darling.
